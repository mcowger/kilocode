This tool is designed for step-by-step task tracking, allowing you to confirm completion of each step before updating, update multiple task statuses at once (e.g., mark one as completed and start the next), and dynamically add new todos discovered during long or complex tasks.

**Checklist Format:**
- Use a single-level markdown checklist (no nesting or subtasks).
- List todos in the intended execution order.
- Status options:
	 - [ ] Task description (pending)
	 - [x] Task description (completed)
	 - [-] Task description (in progress)

**Status Rules:**
- [ ] = pending (not started)
- [x] = completed (fully finished, no unresolved issues)
- [-] = in_progress (currently being worked on)

**Core Principles:**
- Before updating, always confirm which todos have been completed since the last update.
- You may update multiple statuses in a single update (e.g., mark the previous as completed and the next as in progress).
- When a new actionable item is discovered during a long or complex task, add it to the todo list immediately.
- Do not remove any unfinished todos unless explicitly instructed.
- Always retain all unfinished tasks, updating their status as needed.
- Only mark a task as completed when it is fully accomplished (no partials, no unresolved dependencies).
- If a task is blocked, keep it as in_progress and add a new todo describing what needs to be resolved.
- Remove tasks only if they are no longer relevant or if the user requests deletion.
